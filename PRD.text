PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
1. Overview
Product Name: FarmFlow
Vision: To be the digital notebook for commercial farmers, helping them track daily tasks, expenses, animal health, and inventory with ease and accuracy.
Target Users: Commercial farmers with 1000+ animals, multiple species (broilers, layers, fish, maggots).
Key Value Propositions:

Replace paper-based records with a digital system.

Reduce missed tasks and medication schedules.

Track expenses and inventory in real-time.

Improve animal health management.

2. User Stories
Authentication & Onboarding
As a new farmer, I want to sign up with my email and farm details so that I can start using the app.

As a returning farmer, I want to log in to access my farm data.

Dashboard
As a farmer, I want to see an overview of my farm's key metrics (total animals, today's tasks, feed remaining, monthly expenses) so that I can quickly assess the status.

Flock Management
As a farmer, I want to add a new flock (batch of animals) with details (animal type, start date, initial count) so that I can track them.

As a farmer, I want to view a list of my flocks and their current status (active, sold, harvested) so that I can manage them.

Task Management
As a farmer, I want to create daily tasks (feeding, cleaning, medication) with scheduled times and frequencies so that I don't forget them.

As a farmer, I want to mark tasks as completed and optionally add notes and proof images so that I have a record.

As a farmer, I want to see today's tasks and receive reminders (in-app and email) for upcoming tasks.

Expense Tracking
As a farmer, I want to log expenses (feed, medication, labor, equipment) with amount, category, and optional receipt image so that I can track my spending.

As a farmer, I want to view my expenses by date and category so that I can understand my costs.

Health Records
As a farmer, I want to record health issues (disease, injury, vaccination) for a flock with description, treatment, and cost so that I can monitor animal health.

As a farmer, I want to view the health history of a flock so that I can identify patterns.

Inventory Management
As a farmer, I want to track inventory items (feed, medication, equipment) with current stock and low stock alerts so that I can reorder in time.
